# Data Cleaning Project

- In this project I demonstrate data cleaning for a time series dataset used for prediction. I combine different files from different sources to create a final CSV file with 9 features comprised of the DOW JONES closing price and several economic indicators. 
- The end result is a dataset that is ready to be fed into a ML algorithim that handles time series prediction.
- The target column is the Michigan Consumer Index Survey (CSI) which tends to move financial markets significantly.

- A live notebook can be viewed at  the nbviewer link below.

## Getting Started

I ran the program on a local machine with latest anaconda installation and pandas 3.6. 
- As with all python\anaconda projects, it's best to run this on a conda virtual enviroment.

### Prerequisites
